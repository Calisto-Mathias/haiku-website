                         Every programmer goes thru a series of stages in the process of learning and using a programming language.
It&#039s a kind of relationship -- like a marriage, I suppose. It starts off with so much hope and affection,
stumbles thru the peaks and valleys of elation and disgust, and ends up, if intact, in a respectful
(if not always happy) standoff.
<p> 
One fateful night several years ago, while staring bleary-eyed at my monitor and sipping on
weak tea, this semi-epiphany came upon me. The pattern of abuse and enlightenment that accompanied
my battles with Visual Basic suddenly seemed eerily familiar. Memories of my earlier struggles with C, C++,
and a number of other minor language forays seeped in. Of course! These were not random events -- there&#039s
a signal in there. I wrote down the seven stages, forgot my name, then went to sleep.
<p> 
<b>The Seven Stages</b> 

<ol> 
<li> Babe in the woods 
<li> Copycat
<li> Daredevil
<li> Apprentice
<li> Patriot
<li> Prisoner
<li> Master
</ol> 

While I haven&#039t programmed VB in quite awhile, the stages remain true.
All the world&#039s a framework, and we are merely coders. The path we will take in our journeys is unknown,
but the scenery is nice, and some stops along the way simply can&#039t be missed. What would Ernie say?

<p><br> 
<b>Ernie</b> 
<p> 
Let me now introduce our hypothetical subject -- a young, fresh-faced college kid named Ernie J. Whipplemore.
Ernie decides that learning C++ is simply one of life&#039s most important tasks. He&#039s read all about it and
is enthralled by the power it will give him. He will master the languager or die. So what does Ernie have in store?

<p><br> 
<b>Babe in the woods</b> 
<p> 
Dazed and confused. Ernie spends a lot of time reading C++ books and studying examples.
It&#039s not much fun to know so little, but learning is still a kick, and a challenge not be backed away from.
Simply compiling a sample program is an accomplishment. But a sweet one at that... until an attempted
minor change screws up everyting. Ernie, meet compiler diagnostics... compiler diagnostics, meet Ernie.
<p> 
Ernie will likely send out a few desperate emails during this stage. Hopefully the gurus lurking on the
developer mailing lists he has subscribed to have gentle souls, because some of his questions will evoke
considerable humor and disbelief. Ernie will learn to delete those emails from his drive.

<p><br> 
<b>Copycat</b> 
<p> 
Things are starting to make sense. Ernie finds that he can successfully create a range of programs
that run and actually do something. His body of work, however, bears more than a striking resemblance
to the work of others. Ernie has become a proficient mimic.
<p> 
Imitation is the sincerest form of productivity, and Ernie&#039s fingers become quite familiar with his
editor&#039s copy and paste keys.
He doesn&#039t always fully understand why his programs work, but that they do is a source of comfort.
Still, it would be nice to veer off the beaten path once in awhile. Back to the books.

<p><br> 
<b>Daredevil</b> 
<p> 
Wheeeeeeee! Programming is fun!
<p> 
It&#039s wonderful to be so clever. And how convenient that there are so many tricks and techniques for
expressing one&#039s cleverness! Operator overloading, virtual base classes, iostreams, polymorphism.
Anyone for template instantiated recursion via multiple inheritence?
<p> 
Ernie has fallen into the perpetual newbie programmer trap -- that of writing programs that are less about
getting something done than of displaying the author&#039s genius.
Don&#039t ask him if any of this stuff is really needed. Who friggin cares? This sh*t is simply too cool!

<p><br> 
<b>Apprentice</b> 
<p> 
Well, the good times can&#039t last forever. At some point, Ernie begins to take critical note of his work.
Why does his associate Frank write code that has far fewer bugs, runs 3X quicker, and is written
in much less time? For the first time, Ernie begins to ponder the difference between writing a program
that works and writing a good program.
<p> 
"So what does Frank have that I don&#039t have?", ponders Ernie. So begins his quest to find the holy
grail. Ernie adopts a mentor and begins to lap up the wisdom, as fast as he can. The mentor may
be a workmate, an online acquaintance,... perhaps a hard copy of "Extreme Programming".

<p> 
Silver bullets left and right... flying in so fast, it&#039s impossible to escape a direct hit.
Naturally, there is no end to the stream of (often conflicting) programming prescriptions being
proffered. But which advice is right? Ernie will have to choose.

<p><br> 
<b>Patriot</b> 
<p> 
At last, success! Having found a system that works for him, Ernie is ready to take on the world. He will begin
each coding day by pledging allegiance to the flag of XYZ methodology.
<p> 
This is perhaps the longest phase of them all. A certain mastery has been achieved and the
game rules seem very clear. That the rules are essentially arbitrary is not a valuable concept at this stage.
<p> 
Patriots are truly productive. Probably 90% or more of all the production code being run in the world
is the work of patriots.They write the songs that make the whole world sing (to their tune, of course).
<p> 
There is an undeniable stamp to patriot code: it&#039s highly structured, complex, and very tightly
(over?) engineered. Though the code works and works well, it has a certain rigidity. That rigidity prevents
more flexible and elegant designs from being created. One structure requires another. Conversions are
then required to translate between them. Functions pile up into libraries. Libraries pile up into frameworks.
The hard disk drive and memory chip makers owe a debt of gratitude to the hard work of patriot programmers
whose complex systems have no end to their resource requirements.
<p> 

<p><br> 
<b>Prisoner</b> 
<p> 
Paradise lost. As the years pass by, Ernie notices something unpleasant but unmistakable: no amount of
care or adherence to the golden rules prevents all problems. Bugs still surface as reliably as
mold on bread. Projects still fall behind schedule. Major sections of code that were supposed to be
extensible for 1000 years continue to need total rewrites.
<p> 
What a burden! Isn&#039t there a better way to handle all this mess?
Prisoners still get work done, but with little joy. The lure of other programming languages, tools,
platforms, and methodologies is strong. The lure of sunny south-sea islands with miles of sandy beaches
and not a computer within sight is even stronger.
<p> 
Many will jump ship at this stage. Buf if Ernie hangs on, he may find a new way.
<p><br> 
<b>Master</b> 
<p> 
Time to snatch the pebble from the hand. Ernie has some fresh thoughts:
Could it be that good code is produced by talented, conscientious human beings and not by tools and methodologies?
Could it be that even the best code is no match for the relentless march of technological fads and
the changing whims and follies of users over time?
<p> 
The best defense is nimbleness. Ernie masters the art of the light touch. A collection of scripts
may work as well as a full-blown application. Programming tools can be mixed and matched as needed:
a smidge of perl or python when adequate, or a complete custom C++ framework when called for.
Whatever works best.
<p> 
A master is not afraid to break the rules. Bad code is sometimes good code... but not necessarily.
He understands the reasons behind the rules and thus knows when it makes sense to bypass them.
Rules are less important than understanding the problem. Passing on that understanding is even
more important.
<p> 
Masters define the environment in which they work instead of the other way around.
Don&#039t like the language? Write your own. Don&#039t like the OS? Write your own.
But this may not be necessary or even desirable. Nothing is ultimately required or excluded.
<p><br> 
<b>Footnote:</b> 
<p> 
So, did Ernie make it to this heightened awareness? You bet!
Ernie is now a master and has achieved bliss. He earns a high salary, lives in a beautiful home,
and is married to a wonderful woman. Unfortunately, his standard routine of sitting at a desk all day
has led him to become overweight, carpal tunnel has invaded his hands, and his wife just left him for another man.
But hey, don&#039t feel too bad -- he&#039s only a hypothetical guy anyway.
<p> 
Oh, and you are wondering, perhaps, where I place myself on this scale of programming enlightenment?
Since I have outlined the entire chain, I must consider myself a master, no?
Well, actually there is another stage, unmentioned above, that is an off-ramp from the main road.
And I would gladly tell you more about it, except that the Jester never reveals his tricks.

                         	This document describes the feature of the BeOS kernel to monitor nodes. First,
	there is an explanation of what kind of functionality we have to reproduce (along
	with the higher level API), then we will present the implementation in OpenBeOS.

	<h3>Requirements - Exported Functionality in BeOS</h3>

	From user-level, BeOS exports the following API as found in the storage/NodeMonitor.h
	header file:

	<pre>
	status_t watch_node(const node_ref *node, 
		uint32 flags, 
		BMessenger target);

	status_t watch_node(const node_ref *node, 
		uint32 flags, 
		const BHandler *handler,
		const BLooper *looper = NULL);

	status_t stop_watching(BMessenger target);

	status_t stop_watching(const BHandler *handler, 
		const BLooper *looper = NULL);
	</pre>

	The kernel also exports two other functions to be used from file system add-ons
	that causes the kernel to send out notification messages:
	
	<pre>
	int notify_listener(int op, nspace_id nsid,
		vnode_id vnida,	vnode_id vnidb,
		vnode_id vnidc, const char *name);
	
	int send_notification(port_id port, long token,
		ulong what, long op, nspace_id nsida,
		nspace_id nsidb, vnode_id vnida,
		vnode_id vnidb, vnode_id vnidc,
		const char *name);
	</pre>

	<p>
	The latter is only used for live query updates, but is obviously called by
	the former. The port/token pair identify a unique BLooper/BHandler pair, and
	it used internally to address those high-level objects from the kernel.
	</p>
	<p>
	When a file system calls the <code>notify_listener()</code> function, it will have
	a look if there are monitors for that node which meet the specified constraints -
	and it will call <code>send_notification()</code> for every single message to be send.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each of the parameters <code>vnida - vnidc</code> has a dedicated meaning:
	<ul>
		<li><b>vnida:</b> the parent directory of the "main" node</li>
		<li><b>vnidb:</b> the target parent directory for a move</li>
		<li><b>vnidc:</b> the node that has triggered the notification to be send</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	The flags parameter in <code>watch_node()</code> understands the following constants:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>B_STOP_WATCHING</b><br>

	</ul>
	<p>
	Node monitors are maintained per team - every team can have up to 4096 monitors, although
	there exists a private kernel call to raise this limit (for example, Tracker is using it
	intensively).
	</p>
	<p>
	The kernel is able to send the BMessages directly to the specified BLooper and BHandler;
	it achieves this using the application kit&#039s token mechanism. The message is constructed
	manually in the kernel, it doesn&#039t use any application kit services.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Meeting the Requirements in an Optimal Way - Implementation in OpenBeOS</h3>

	<p>
	If you assume that every file operation could trigger a notification message to be send,
	it&#039s clear that the node monitoring system must be optimized for sending messages. For
	every call to <code>notify_listener()</code>, the kernel must check if there are any
	monitors for the node that was updated.
	</p>
	<p>
	Those monitors are put into a hash table which has the device number and the vnode ID
	as keys. Each of the monitors maintains a list of listeners which specify which port/token
	pair should be notified for what change. Since the vnodes are created/deleted as needed
	from the kernel, the node monitor is maintained independently from them; a simple pointer
	from a vnode to its monitor is not possible.
	</p>
	<p>
	The main structures that are involved in providing the node monitoring functionality
	look like this:
	</p>

	<pre>
	struct monitor_listener {
		monitor_listener	*next;
		monitor_listener	*prev;
		list_link		monitor_link;
		port_id			port;
		int32			token;
		uint32			flags;
		node_monitor		*monitor;
	};

	struct node_monitor {
		node_monitor		*next;
		mount_id		device;
		vnode_id		node;
		struct list		listeners;
	};
	</pre>

	<p>
	The relevant part of the I/O context structure is this:
	</p>

	<pre>
	struct io_context {
		...
		struct list		node_monitors;
		uint32			num_monitors;
		uint32			max_monitors;
	};
	</pre>

	<p>
	If you call <code>watch_node()</code> on a file with a flags parameter unequal to
	B_STOP_WATCHING, the following will happen in the node monitor:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The <code>add_node_monitor()</code> function does a hash lookup for the
			device/vnode pair. If there is no <code>node_monitor</code> yet for this pair,
			a new one will be created.</li>
		<li>The list of listeners is scanned for the provided port/token pair (the
			BLooper/BHandler pointer will already be translated in user-space), and
			the new flag is or&#039d to the old field, or a new <code>monitor_listener</code>
			is created if necessary - in the latter case, the team&#039s node monitor
			counter is incremented.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	If it&#039s called with B_STOP_WATCHING defined, the reverse operation take effect, and
	the <code>monitor</code> field is used to see if this monitor don&#039t have any listeners
	anymore, in which case it will be removed.
	</p>
	<p>
	Note the presence of the <code>max_monitors</code> - there is no hard limit the kernel
	exposes to userland applications; the listeners are maintained in a doubly-linked list.
	</p>
	<p>
	If a team is shut down, all listeners from its I/O context will be removed - since every
	listener stores a pointer to its monitor, determining the monitors that can be removed
	because of this operation is very cheap.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <code>notify_listener()</code> also only does a hash lookup for the device/node
	pair it got from the file system, and sends out as many notifications as specified by
	the listeners of the monitor that belong to that node.
	</p>
	<p>
	If a node is deleted from the disk, the corresponding <code>node_monitor</code> and its
	listeners will be removed as well, to prevent watching a new file that accidently happen
	to have the same device/node pair (as is possible with BFS, for example).
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>Differences Between Both Implementations</h3>

	<p>
	Although the aim was to create a completely compatible monitoring implementation,
	there are some notable differences between the two.
	</p>
	<p>
	BeOS reserves a certain number of slots for calls to <code>watch_node()</code> - each
	call to that function will use one slot, even if you call it twice for the same node.
	OpenBeOS, however, will always use one slot per node - you could call <code>watch_node()</code>
	several times, but you would waste only one slot.
	</p>
	<p>
	While this is an implementational detail, it also causes a change in behaviour for
	applications; in BeOS, applications will get one message for every <code>watch_node()</code>
	call, in OpenBeOS, you&#039ll get only one message per node. If an application relies
	on this strange behaviour of the BeOS kernel, it will no longer work correctly.
	</p>
	<p>
	The other difference is that OpenBeOS exports its node monitoring functionality to
	kernel modules as well, and provides an extra plain C API for them to use.
	</p>

	<br>
	<h3>And Beyond?</h3>

	<p>
	The current implementation directly iterates over all listeners and sends out notifications
	as required synchronously in the context of the thread that triggered the notification to
	be sent.
	</p>
	<p>
	If a node monitor needs to send out several messages, this could theoretically greatly
	decrease file system performance. To optimize for this case, the required data of the
	notification could be put into a queue and be sent by a dedicated worker thread. Since
	this requires an additional copy operation and a reserved address space for this queue,
	this optimization could be more expensive than the current implementation, depending
	on the usage pattern of the node monitoring mechanism.
	</p>
	<p>
	With BFS, it would be possible to introduce the possibility to automatically watch all
	files in a specified directory. While this would be very convenient at application level,
	it comes with several disadvantages:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>This feature might not be easily accomplishable for many file systems; a file system
			must be able to retrieve a node by ID only - it might not be feasible to find
			out about the parent directory for many file systems.</li>
		<li>Although it could potentially safe node monitors, it might cause the kernel to
			send out a lot more messages to the application than it needs. With the restriction
			the kernel imposes to the number of watched nodes for a team, the application&#039s
			designer might try to be much stricter with the number of monitors his application
			will consume.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	While 1) might be a real show stopper, 2) is almost invalidated because of Tracker&#039s
	usage of node monitors; it consumes a monitor for every entry it displays, which might
	be several thousands. Implementing this feature would not only greatly speed up maintaining
	this massive need of monitors, and cut down memory usage, but also ease the implementation
	at application level.
	</p>
	<p>
	Even 1) could be solved if the kernel could query a file system if it can support
	this particular feature; it could then automatically monitor all files in that directory
	without adding complexity to the application using this feature. Of course,
	the effort to provide this functionality is much larger then - but for applications
	like Tracker, the complexity would be removed from the application without extra cost.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, none of the discussed feature extensions have been implemented for the currently
	developed version R1 of OpenBeOS.

                         <p>I heard a friend of mine on the phone recently speaking with his wife, or perhaps one of his children.  I don&#039t know what the conversation was about, but he said "I&#039ll take care of it".  It struck me profoundly--that is exactly a father&#039s job.  Whether it&#039s the water heater breaking down, or broken hearts, or even just a bad day of school, a father is called on to be the ultimate cure-all for whatever issues there are in family.  That he, too, is human doesn&#039t enter into the equation.  It doesn&#039t matter if he had a bad day at work, or if he is depressed, or even if he is just tired: It is still his job to take care of it.  When everyone else needs him, he is there.  He is the core, the nucleus, and the center of the family.</p>



<p>Leadership is much the same whether it is leadership of the family or leadership of an open source project.  When there are hard decisions to be made, or tedious work to be done, the brunt of the burden often falls on the leader to ensure that it happens.  Leaders accept that as part of their job.  When bad decisions are made, responsibility should fall only on the shoulders of the leader.  One example of this in our community was when Be announced the discontinuation of support for the BeBox (the first time).  There was a loud cry from the community.  JLG personally responded that a mistake had been made and that support would be continued for three years.  This is a great example of how leadership should work--people make mistakes and sometimes make bad assumptions, but when they do, they own up to them and correct them personally.</p>



<p>Which brings me to ask: What is leadership?</p>



<p>Many people believe that leadership is the process of telling people what to do, clearing off your desk, putting your feet up, and allowing others to do the work.  The same people, when faced with difficult situations, oftentimes wonder why their employees won&#039t back them up.  They hold only the whip over their employees.  They believe that great vision statements, glorious five-year plans, and profound press releases will inspire their troops.  Their employees don&#039t see them as part of the team but oftentimes as part of the problem.  One of the most useful things that I have learned in my career is that no one person in a business or in any organization is more important than any other.  If you don&#039t believe that, try firing your janitor.  Try hiring a surly temp as your receptionist.  Other people believe that people are replaceable, interchangeable like bricks.  Oftentimes (in business especially) management fails to realize the value of longevity.  The people who have been around your business the longest are the people who know the most about it and are the most valuable.  One of the surest signs of bad leadership is an exodus of experienced employees.  One of the surest signs of good leadership conversely is high employee retention.</p>



<p>My definition of leadership is "to influence, guide, protect, encourage, and assist through example, planning, clear communication, and kindness."</p>



<ul>

<li>influence -- instead of ordering people (which should be a last resort) to do what needs to be done, persuading them is a far better choice

<li>guide -- sharing your experience, perspective, knowledge, and viewpoint to help others grow

<li>protect -- whether this is standing up for your team members, or defending your family there is no more powerful way to show whose side you&#039re on

<li>encourage -- everyone gets discouraged sometimes and needs someone who has been in their shoes to let them know that things will be better

<li>assist -- when the team member needs help, their leader is the first person they should be able to turn to for assistance

<li>example -- the primary way that a leader should lead is by example--being the personification of what they want their team members to be

<li>planning -- a team without a vision wanders aimlessly

<li>clear communication -- if the leader has a plan but the team doesn&#039t know it they are no better off than if they had no plan at all

<li>kindness -- it may seem obvious but the golden rule still stands--do unto others as you would have them do unto you

</ul>



<p>I believe that there is no more difficult position than leading volunteers.  Unlike a job or a family there is little formal structure holding a team member in place.  There is a personal cost if you quit your job or if you leave your family.  There is also no more rewarding position than leading volunteers for the same reason--if you keep the team together, it is a validation of your leadership.</p>
