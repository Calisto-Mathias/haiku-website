<p>Haiku's package manager presents installed packages as a read-only filesystem, so unlike other systems, it is not possible to just delete or rename a problematic driver or library. However, individual packaged files can be prevented from being exposed at boot time.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/docs/userguide/en/bootloader.html">Boot Options menu</a>, there is a "Disable components" option available to accomplish this. However, this method will only let you disable components of the main (<code>haiku</code>) system package, and only until the next time you reboot.</p>

<p>Let's go through the few steps needed:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Figure out which package contains the file that you want to disable, and whether the file is in a package located in the system or user file hierarchy. You can find the containing package name with "Get info" from Tracker's context menu on that file; look for <code>SYS:PACKAGE</code> in its "Attributes" tab.</li>
 <li>Next, create a text file named <code>packages</code> in <code>/boot/system/settings</code>, or in <code>/boot/home/config/settings</code>. (The first folder is used for disabling components in system packages, the second for user packages.)</li>
 <li>Inside the <code>packages</code> file, we put something like:
<pre>Package <i>package_name</i> {
	BlockedEntries {
		<i>path/to/blocked/entry</i>
		...
	}
}
</pre>
 <ul>
  <li><i><code>package_name</code></i> is the name of the package without version, for example <code>haiku</code>.</li>
  <li><i><code>path/to/blocked/entry</code></i> is the relative path to the installation location, e.g. <code>add-ons/Translators/FooTranslator</code>.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Any disabled entries will be ignored by packagefs and will no longer appear in the file system, until they are removed from the <code>BlockedEntries</code> list and the system rebooted again.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>To disable the <code>intel_extreme</code> driver and the <code>xhci</code> driver, which are both part of the <code>haiku</code> system package, the we create a <code>/boot/system/settings/packages</code> and give it the following content:

<pre>Package haiku  {
	BlockedEntries {
		add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/intel_extreme
		add-ons/kernel/busses/usb/xhci
	}
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>We then save the file and reboot. Once Haiku starts again, the file will be ignored by packagefs when the package is mounted.<p>
