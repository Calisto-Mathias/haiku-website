FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for the community. The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

* get in touch with other developers and projects;
* be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;
* be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;
* attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers;
* to promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions.


Participation and attendance is *totally* free, though the organisers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.

This year FOSDEM is an online event because it's not safe to gather so much people in person.
