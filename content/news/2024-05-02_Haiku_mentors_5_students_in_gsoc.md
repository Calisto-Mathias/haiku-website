<p>For many years now, Haiku is a regular participant in the Google Summer of Code program, which
offers paid mentorship to people willing to work full time on Haiku for a few months. Google
handles the payments, while mentors from our developer team handle the onboarding of the new
contributors and guide them through the project.</p>

<p>We received several great applications this year, and 5 developers were selected!</p>

<ul>
<li>Calisto Abel Mathias, mentored by Nielx and Humdinger, will work on redesigning the Tracker query window to make it more user friendly.</li>
<li>Daniel Martin, mentored by Scottmc and Waddlesplash, will work on accelerated virtualization for QEMU using NVMM.</li>
<li>Diego Roux, mentored by Korli, will work on a virtio audio driver, for use when Haiku is used inside a virtual machine.</li>
<li>Trungnt2910 (who worked on C# in GSoC 2023), will be mentored by Waddlesplash to work on improving Debugger and making GDB or LLDB usable for debugging Haiku applications.</li>
<li>Zardsahrd (who worked on Icon-O-Matic in GSoC 2023), will be mentored by PulkoMandy to work on the WebKit2 port to Haiku.</li>
