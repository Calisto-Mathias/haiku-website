After a year and a half since the last beta, Haiku R1/beta4 has been released. See "**[Release Notes](/get-haiku/r1beta4/release-notes/)**" for the release notes, "[Press contact](/get-haiku/r1beta4/release-notes/#press-contact)", for press inquiries ... and "**[Get Haiku!](/get-haiku/r1beta4/)**" to skip all that and just download the release (or upgrade to it from an existing install!)
