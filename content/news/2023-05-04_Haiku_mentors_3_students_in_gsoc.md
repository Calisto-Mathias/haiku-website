<p>For many years now, Haiku is a regular participant in the Google Summer of Code program, which
offers paid mentorship to people willing to work full time on Haiku for a few months. Google
handles the payments, while mentors from our developer team handle the onboarding of the new
contributors and guide them through the project.</p>

<p><a href="/community/gsoc/2023">Read more</a> about Google Summer of Code 2021.</p>

<p>This year, 3 developers were selected.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pairisto will be mentored by korli and scottmc and will work on the TUN virtual network interface
driver (with the goal of eventually allowing usage of VPN applications in Haiku, but also useful for
virtual machines such as QEMU to access the network more efficiently).</li>
<li>trungnt2910 will be mentored by jessicah and will port the .NET Developer Platform (compiler and
runtime) to Haiku, making it possible to build and run C# code on Haiku.</li>
<li>Zardshard will be mentored by PulkoMandy and humdinger, and will work on improving and
polishing Icon-O-Matic</li>
</ul>

<p>Please welcome them to the community! You may have already met them on the forums and IRC, and
they already have submitted several patches for review, so we're looking forward to a very
productive summer!</p>
